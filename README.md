‚ùóTo commen concern about dataset:

Recently, there have been clear changes in the open-source policy and regulations of our overall organization's code, data, and models.
Despite this, we have still worked hard to obtain opening the weights of the model first, but the data involves stricter auditing and is in review with our legal team .
Our researchers have no authority to publicly release them without authorization.
Thank you for your understanding.

## Hiring

- &#x1F4E3; We are looking for highly motivated students to join us as interns to create more intelligent AI together. Please contact caxu@microsoft.com

<!-- Although on our **complexity-balanced test set**, **WizardLM-7B has more cases that are preferred by human labelers than ChatGPT** in the high-complexity instructions (difficulty level >= 8), it still lags behind ChatGPT on the entire test set, and we also consider WizardLM to still be in a **baby state**. This repository will **continue to improve WizardLM**, train on larger scales, add more training data, and innovate more advanced large-model training methods. -->


<b>Note for model system prompts usage:</b>

To obtain results **identical to our demo**, please strictly follow the prompts and invocation methods provided in the **"src/infer_wizardlm13b.py"** to use our model for inference. Our model adopts the prompt format from <b>Vicuna</b> and supports **multi-turn** conversation.

<b>For WizardLM</b>, the Prompt should be as following:

```
A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Hi ASSISTANT: Hello.</s>USER: Who are you? ASSISTANT: I am WizardLM.</s>......
```

<b>For WizardCoder </b>, the Prompt should be as following:

```
"Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\n{instruction}\n\n### Response:"
```

<b>For WizardMath</b>, the Prompts should be as following:

**Default version:**

```
"Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\n{instruction}\n\n### Response:"
```


**CoT Version:** Ôºà‚ùóFor the **simple** math questions, we do NOT recommend to use the CoT prompt.Ôºâ 


```
"Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\n{instruction}\n\n### Response: Let's think step by step."
```

### GPT-4 automatic evaluation

We adopt the automatic evaluation framework based on GPT-4 proposed by FastChat to assess the performance of chatbot models. As shown in the following figure, WizardLM-30B achieved better results than Guanaco-65B.

</p>

### WizardLM-30B performance on different skills.

The following figure compares WizardLM-30B and ChatGPT‚Äôs skill on Evol-Instruct testset. The result indicates that WizardLM-30B achieves 97.8% of ChatGPT‚Äôs performance on average, with almost 100% (or more than) capacity on 18 skills, and more than 90% capacity on 24 skills.

### WizardLM performance on NLP foundation tasks.

The following table provides a comparison of WizardLMs and other LLMs on NLP foundation tasks. The results indicate that WizardLMs consistently exhibit superior performance in comparison to the LLaMa models of the same size. Furthermore, our WizardLM-30B model showcases comparable performance to OpenAI's Text-davinci-003 on the MMLU and HellaSwag benchmarks.

| Model            | MMLU 5-shot | ARC 25-shot | TruthfulQA 0-shot | HellaSwag 10-shot | Average    |

### WizardLM performance on code generation.

The following table provides a comprehensive comparison of WizardLMs and several other LLMs on the code generation task, namely HumanEval. The evaluation metric is pass@1. The results indicate that WizardLMs consistently exhibit superior performance in comparison to the LLaMa models of the same size. Furthermore, our WizardLM-30B model surpasses StarCoder and OpenAI's code-cushman-001. Moreover, our Code LLM, WizardCoder, demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a pass@1 score of 57.3, surpassing the open-source SOTA by approximately 20 points.

## Call for Feedbacks
We welcome everyone to use your professional and difficult instructions to evaluate WizardLM, and show us examples of poor performance and your suggestions in the [issue discussion](https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM/issues) area. We are focusing on improving the Evol-Instruct now and hope to relieve existing weaknesses and issues in the the next version of WizardLM. After that, we will open the code and pipeline of up-to-date Evol-Instruct algorithm and work with you together to improve it.



## Overview of Evol-Instruct

[Evol-Instruct](https://github.com/nlpxucan/evol-instruct) is a novel method using LLMs instead of humans to automatically mass-produce open-domain instructions of various difficulty levels and skills range, to improve the performance of LLMs. You can easily embark on your own evolutionary journey with the [Evol Script](https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM/tree/main/Evol-Instruct) we provide.
